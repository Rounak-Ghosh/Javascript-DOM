# Javascript-DOM

This project is a part of Coursera Project Network under the title [Introduction to Javascript: The Basics](https://www.coursera.org/projects/intro-to-javascript-the-basics?) under the guidance of Mr. Khaled M. Attia

In this course, we are going to focus on three learning objectives:
- Create Javascript functions that perform a small, specific task and promote code re-use
- Understand how to access and modify HTML elements using the Document Object Model (DOM) interface in Javascript
- Create scripts that handle different events and interact with the DOM based on the triggered events
